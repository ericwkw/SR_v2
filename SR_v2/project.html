      <h3 class="_text">Overview</h3>
      <p class="content">“Websites are too often just a factual, boring, passive CV from which the reader gathers no sense of your individual or corporate personalities nor what makes you different. Be conservative, but brave. Capture the entrepreneurial spirit of Anglo Chinese. Be slightly eccentric or extraordinary like Pavarotti, Dyson, Sir Ranulph Fiennes, and Einstein. Not quite Salvador Dali or Damian Hirst, but you know what I mean!”. Creative Brief, Martin Spurrier, Writer.</p>

        <p>“We cannot compete on being boring!”, said Founder and Managing Director, Christopher Howe. With this in mind, Sedgwick Richardson went on to conceive, design and develop a website that’s aim was NOT to look like an investment bank site, but to exude ‘success’, ‘trust’, ‘personality’ and ‘professionalism’.</p>
        <p>Working closely with a mastermind writer, our amazing photography duo, The Gaunts, and of course the Anglo Chinese team, who gave us complete trust when bringing to life their passions — we created a digital presence like no other financial advisor and investment bank. We showcased the success and uniqueness of Anglo Chinese Group though it’s greatest asset — its people.<br></p>
